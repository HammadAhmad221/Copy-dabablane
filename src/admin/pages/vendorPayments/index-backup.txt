# BACKUP - API INTEGRATED VERSION
# If the file reverts again, this backup can be restored

The index.tsx file should import vendorPaymentApi and fetch real data from:
- GET /back/v1/vendor-payments
- With filters: vendor_id, transfer_status, payment_type, start_date, end_date, etc.

All API integrations have been completed but the file keeps reverting.
